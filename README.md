# Skip Ad

**Skip Ad** is a **Chrome Extension** that can automatically close the video ads on YouTube,
and also hide the video overlay ads (banners) and ads in the column next to the video.

## How it works

#### Without the extension
Before or during the playback of the YouTube video, video ads can be shown.
These ads can be closed with the **Skip Ad** or **Skip Ads** buttons that are displayed after
5 seconds. And so, you not only need to step in, but also wait for the buttons to appear.
A different kind of ads can be video overlay ads that can be closed with the **X** button,
or column ads that cannot be closed.

#### With the extension
Skip Ad will look for the **Skip Ad** or **Skip Ads** buttons,
and click them automatically to close the video ads for you.
Although the buttons are displayed after 5 seconds, they are already prepared
and extension can click them to close the ads quickly.
Video overlay ads, and column ads, will be hidden.
